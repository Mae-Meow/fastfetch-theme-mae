# fastfetch-theme-mae
My custom fastfetch config file with an image insted of CLI OS logo.

(it's set up for Kitty terminal so image will not work in a different terminal with this setup. Additionally depending on your screen resolution you might have to adjust the values for the image width and height. Also feel free to change the image by setting up a different file path in the config <3)
